title: Week 2 - Code of Conduct
---

### In Class Activity

Projects would benefit from having a code of conduct. It sets the expectation of behavior for a diverse group to communicate effictively. The most important part is the enforcement, detailing the repercussions of violating the conduct. Sugar Labs even contains a section concerning developers who leave the community in order to ensure a larger bus factor.

<!-- what are your own thoughts on the importance of Code of Conduct for a project? would you be willing to work on a project that does not have a Code of Conduct? do you think there is a realistic way of enforcing rules listed in the Code of Conduct for a given project? -->

### Thoughts

Currently, I am skeptical about the impact a Code of Conduct would have on how people will collaborate and treat each other. I can acknowledge its potential legal significance in addressing major issues, but for everyday interactions I am unsure of its effectiveness. I am not sure if there is a practical and realistic means of enforcing a Code of Conduct at a more graular level. I would be willing to try working on a project without a Code of Conduct, and would use my experiences and interactions with the community to decide if I would like to further be a part of it.
