### Open Source and ...
I learned about all the different fields open source couls be used outside of code. It was pretty crazy to me, things like open source cars, that I never would have even imagined. I'm curious to see what that kind of world that would look like. If at a certain point people had basic living expenses covered, and they could work on anything, everything could be open source. I also thought the open source printer that could print itself was a really cool project. It also makes me think about how the world eventually can work itself without humans. What I looked into was Thingiverse, a collection of designs (many 3d printed ones) uploaded that anyone can use, and essentially make themselves. This was appealing to me, because I could see myself having a lot of fun with it.

### Pandas Progress
We created a google doc writing down all the discussion points we wanted to hit for the presentation. In addition, we created the slideshow presentation, and it is in progress. We are working on the last few contributions, wrapping it up for the semester!
