### Contributing to Pandas Update
I talked back and forth with one of the main contributors, and found a way to fully set it up and build the code successfully. For some reason, my computer was not using the python inside my virtual environment, so I ended up writing the entire path of the correct python to use. After playing around with different setup options, I found one that worked, and finally finished after almost two weeks and many frustrating hours. I also made my first contribution, creating a pull request to fix one of the docs issues. It has been accepted and successfully merged. Initially, I was facing a build error, and was really confused as to why that was, because I was only changing documentation. <!--more--> Later, I recieved an email from Pandas saying that the test code had some issues, causing the builds to fail for everyone. Lastly, We attending the weekly meeting and was able to meet the main current contributors, and told them about our class and that we would like to work on contributing to Pandas. One of them gave a side project he was working on and offered to personally mentor us. We are currently trying to find something bigger to work on other than docs, and am finding it a little hard.
