### Group Progress 

We chose Pandas as our open source project to contribute to. I am still having issues setting up the development environment, but am in contact with one of the main contributors to help me fix the issues, and will have it ready by the end of break. My entire group has been having problems setting it up, but currently everyone found a way except me. One is using a different computer, and the other two played around with the different setup options.

### Midterm Reflection

I was able to reflect upon the semester so far, seeing how much I learned about what open source means, what makes a good open source project, and how the group work had been this past semester. I learned about how open open source was, to the extent that even terrorists would be allowed to use the software. When contributing to open source, a couple things one should look at is the amount of domain knowledge required, and how active/responsive the community is. I've had great experiences with collaborating in groups this semester, meeting new people, and working on bugs together——my favorite project was the firefox extension.
