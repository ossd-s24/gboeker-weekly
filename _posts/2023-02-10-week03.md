<!-- Comment on the git exercises we did in class. Comment on the work with your team and progress you have made towards your first browser extension (what are some problems the group is facing, what good things happened, how do you fit into the collaboration, what are your biggest contributions) -->


### Git Exercises
I appreciated our review of git basics. Previously, my understanding of git was pieced together through various oneline searches through trial and error. Having a structured overiew in class provided clarity and a better foundation I can refer back to when needed.

### Firefox Browser Extension

Our team successfully completed our Firefox browser extension, Find N Replace. The extension allows users to find specific text on a webpage and replace it with alternative text. Throughout the development process, we encountered various problems, from collaborating on the same files, to working out the logic of finding and replacing text. We had difficulty extracting text from the page and being able to share that with the popup. And after we figured that out, had issues with it working more than once.


I took the lead in implementing the popup interface, helping debug, and refining the codebase. Our group communicated effectively and collaborated efficiently. I learned a great deal from both research and the support of my teammates. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we've made and our contributions to creating an open-source browser extension.
