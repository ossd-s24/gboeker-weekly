title: Week 11 - Open Source in Industries
---

<!-- Make your blog post. Reflect on the videos you watched about different industries' use of open source technologies, the reasons behind use of open source and the relationship between industry and open source projects. Also reflect on your group's progress on the project. Are there surprises in the project you selected. What has been the biggest challenge so far. -->


### Video Reflections
I thought it was interesting to learn about the use of open source in businesses through this week's videos and guest speaker. I never considered how integrated open source is into industries and closed source companies. One of the videos talked about Inner Source, a term I never heard of before. Where closed source companies adopt open source methods of contribution and can have many benefits including higher ownership of code, and overall better collaboration. I was also suprised at how applicable open source is outside of tech, even film can benefit from it.

### Pandas Progress

I created my first PR that was not a documentation issue. Still a more simple issue, of depreciating the camelcase startingMonth to snake case starting_month. I don't know the best way to do this, but I searched through all the files, changing the name, and now am encountering build errors. I've asked for help in the slack, but haven't gotten an answer yet. I think my next steps are doing a bit more research into how variables are actually depreciated. I'm worried about how much I'm struggling with small contributions, and not sure where to start for bigger, code issues.
