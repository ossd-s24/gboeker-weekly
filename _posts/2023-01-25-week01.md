title: Week 1 â€” Intro to Open Source
---

<!---
address the following points in your post (keep in mind that your blog post should be just prose, not a Q&A for the prompts below; it should include formatting to make it more readable, and it can include links and images if you wish)

open source (what do YOU think about when you hear the term "open source"? what are some advantages of open vs. closed source, what are some potential problems with open source, why did you decide to register for a class about open source software development?)

projects: briefly talk about four open source projects that you regularly use or that influenced you in some way in the past (note, the projects do not have to be source code based) (Keep in mind that these blogs are publicly available to anybody who stumbles upon them. Make sure that the posts are appropriate.)

### Open Source 
When I think of open source, I think of software that is freely accessible, modifiable, and transparency. Some advantages with closed source is that there is more organized and maintained support. I noticed open source applications to be less visually polished than <!--more-->closed source apps. The benefits of open source is in its transparency, cost, and security. I aim to contribute to larger projects to gain practical experience, collaborate within a team, and better my understanding of open source.

### What I've Used
I use wikipedia, visual studio code, python regularly, and I have used vlc media player, eclipse, and atom in the past.
